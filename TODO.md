✅ Data Normalization - The current time format in the scraped data is reversed (e.g., "09:00 - 07:00" means 7:00 to 9:00). We could normalize this to make it more intuitive.
✅ Filtering Options - Add ability to filter slots by boat type, time range, or day of week.
Availability Monitoring - Create a monitoring system that checks for newly available slots and sends notifications.
Data Analysis - Add functionality to analyze patterns in slot availability to identify optimal booking times.
✅ Error Recovery - Enhance error handling to automatically retry failed requests with exponential backoff.
Proxy Support - Add support for using proxies to avoid potential IP blocking during intensive scraping.
Slot Comparison - Add functionality to compare available slots across different dates to find the best options.
✅ Booking Integration - Extend the scraper to not just find slots but also automate the booking process.
Historical Data Analysis - Store historical slot data to analyze trends in availability over time.
